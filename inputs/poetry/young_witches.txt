Young witches have green eyes,
And watchful in a slanting wise;

Green as the ice in the North Sea,
Green as the leaf of a young birch-tree

In a forest of pinesâ€”a flickering green
That is more caught in a breath than seen

Young witches have strange eyes
As spring twilight, and glances wise.

Green they are as the April rain,
And they darken never with love or pain.
